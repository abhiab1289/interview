How to create SFTP service in Azure cloud.
Certainly! To set up an **SFTP service in Azure**, you have a couple of options:

1. **Azure Blob Storage with SFTP Support**:
    - You can securely connect to the Blob Storage endpoint of an Azure Storage account using an **SFTP client**. Here's how to do it:

        - **Prerequisites**:
            - A standard general-purpose v2 or premium block blob storage account (you can also enable SFTP during account creation).
            - The hierarchical namespace feature of the account must be enabled.
            - If connecting from an on-premises network, ensure that your client allows outgoing communication through **port 22** (used by SFTP).
        
        - **Enable SFTP Support**:
            1. In the **Azure portal**, navigate to your storage account.
            2. Under **Settings**, select **SFTP** (this option appears only if the hierarchical namespace feature is enabled).
            3. Click **Enable SFTP**. If no local users appear, add at least one of them (see the next section for details).

        - **Disable SFTP Support**:
            1. In the **Azure portal**, navigate to your storage account.
            2. Under **Settings**, select **SFTP**.
            3. Click **Disable SFTP**.

        - **Configure Permissions**:
            - Azure Storage doesn't support shared access signatures (SAS) or Microsoft Enterprise authentication for accessing the SFTP endpoint. Instead, use an identity called **local user** secured with an Azure-generated password or an SSH key pair. Grant access to connecting clients by associating a local user with the password or key pairÂ¹.

2. **Azure Data Factory with SFTP Connector**:
    - If you need to **copy and transform data** from an SFTP server, you can use **Azure Data Factory**. Follow these steps:

        - Browse to the **Manage** tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace.
        - Select **Linked Services** and click **New**.
        - Search for **SFTP** and choose the **SFTP connector**.
        - Configure the service details, test the connection, and create the new linked serviceÂ².

Remember to choose the option that best fits your requirements! ðŸš€.
